# arduino-anti-theft-system-
This project represents a safety system for motorcycles using Arduino uno, MEMS accelerometer sensor adxl345, push button and a speaker. When the person leaves the motorcycle, he/she can start the system with the push button integrated on the vehicle, then the accelerometer is reading different acceleration values on the x, y and z axis. When the given acceleration value written in the code is crossed on the z axis (someone has attempted to move the motorcycle), the speaker alarms the owner or people nearby. The sound that is emitted by the speaker is also written in the code.
